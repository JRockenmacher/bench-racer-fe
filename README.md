# bench-racer-fe

Bench-Racer, an app to track and plan expenditures in the adventure of owning a performance car. The big-idea is to calculate the cost of any particular mod you are adding to your car. The interface is arbitrary so some of the onus is on the user to make sure they add all the parts needed for a job and calculate the price of parts (with future implemenations to add more specifics including retailer and links to parts if they are availible online, so the user doesn't need to keep track of that information in messy notes or documents. The user can populate their garage with their own and prospective/ dream cars, so they can even nerd out and build their dream machine, without spending a dime! It employs a clean interface that doesn't disract from its main job: helping garage tuners have less downtime and prioritize projects!
